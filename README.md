# Space Stranding
Code and assets for the small 2D platformer Space Stranding

Space Stranding is a small game I made to test some tools (mainly Lua/Love2D and audio tools like sfxia) and strategies before participating in a Ludum Dare game jam. Uploading it to github so I can dust off the old account and make sure I know what I'm doing when I need to publish Ludum Dare entries.

## Game play
You're an untethered astronaut trying desperately to not be stuck in orbit. Make it back to the center of the space station before running out of fuel or being struck by an asteroid. 

W/Up - Boost "forward"
A/left - Rotate counterclockwise
D/right - Rotate clockwise
R - Flip the astronaut (not necessary but can be aesthetically pleasing)
Escape - Return to the Main Menu from anywhere
